\section{Skills}

Four key skills that are considered weaknesses:

Time Management
Patience/persistance
Problem solving
Prioritising tasks
Planning

A key skill that i consider a big weakness is time management as I do tend to leave things to the last minute. Time management directly affected the quality of my work as I tend to rush things at the last minute, this means the qulaity of my work is not as good as it could be if I spent more time working on in it in the past.

Time management is key element for any project, as it affects how much work can get done within the time limit. 

A way to help improve this weakness would be to provide a plan of when to complete each section of the project and make sure that all sections are completed atleast a week before the deadline so that there is time to make changes if necessary.

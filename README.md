# comp110-worksheets
A template for the COMP110 worksheets and the weekly reflective reports.

##Week 2
This week I worked on the SpaceChem assignment for Comp110, I enjoyed playing the game and found some of the levels fairly challenging. I spent a lot of time working on the wrong type of levels though. I can already kind of see how this is kind of problem solving will relate to coding later on in the course.
I used github to submit the work, but found it pretty hard to get my head around how github works, I'm still not 100% sure on how it does work, so i'll have to try and familiarise myself with it over the next week or so.
I also dowloaded LaTeX on my home computer and started playing with the features and getting a feel for the software. I really like using it, as it makes referencing and general formatting a lot easier and more professional than in programs such as Word.

##Week 3
I spent week 3 doing a bit of research for the comp 130 essay, looking at library resources, as well as getting general knowlege about the console i was going to work on from general online sources.
I also started writing notes about the sega master system for the group presentation.
We started learning about python with JES, and i think i uderstood most of what was being said in the lectures, but I think i just need to play around with it a bit more to fully understand.

##Week 4
Presented the group presentation.
Went through in more detail about writing academic essays, most of which I kinda knew already, but it was helpful to have a referesher. 
We went into more detail about Python and manipulating pictures using loops, classes etc.. 
I found some of the algorithms fairly hard to comprehend, but after spending a bit of time playing around with what each of the individual JES functions does, i feel like i have slightly improved my ability to read large blocks of pyton code. 
This knowledge is important to me as a practitioner because i am not yet confident about reading and understanding large blocks of code.
I will now need to continue to write my own code and try to memorise the syntax for python and JES.

##Week 5
In week 5 we learnt about Agile development and how that could improve our productivity, which then me and my partner put into practice by creating a plan for the tinkering graphics project.
For me the most useful experience this week was the peer review of my essay, this gave me a clear idea of what needs improving. Having read the peer reviews I now feel that i know what to work on to improve the quality of the essay.
This knowledge will be useful to me as a learner because I am still learning how to structure my essay in the proper manner. I will now need to make the aproprite changes to my essay based on the peer review feedback.

##Week R
In reading week, me and my pair-programming partner met-up almost every day that week to work on the tinkering graphics contracts. I struggled trying to implement some of the features on our sprint plan, especially the zoom function as I ran into a lot of problems with that.
I also spent a lot of the week working on my flow-chart and pseudo code for comp 120, I struggled a lot with this as I am not familiar with pesudo code and was not sure how in-depth to go; i.e. whether to state variables or just a general overview.
Then spent a bit of reading week focusing on my essay, and making changes from the peer review.


##Week 6
Handed in Comp130 game history essay, although I had a tutor meeting at 11:30 and the essay was due at 12, and my tutor said some things were wrong with my bibliography but unfortuantly I did not have time to edit it before the submission. 
Next time I will book an earlier session, or try and get my tutor to look at it at an earlier date.
After that I continued to work on my tinkering graphics projects with my pair-programming partner, I found it hard to keep on track with the sprint plans, as I would get distracted and focus on something else if it wasn't working. 
This is definatly something I need to work on, and try to just focus on the task at hand, instead of just giving up and working on something else for a bit.
At the end of the week we had a guest lecture from Ian Livingstone which I really enjoyed.

##Week 7
In week 7 we started looking into the kivy framework, for me this was the biggest issue I had, as at first i felt there was a big learning curve when looking at pycharm code compared to JES code.
However after playing around with the pong tutorial, and just generaly trying to understand how object orientated programming works, I felt I un a understoond a bit of it, but i'm still going to have to spend more time at home playing around with the pong tutorial and trying to see how inheritance and other OOP features work.
Also started looking for COMP110 references, this did not take me that long, as the scholarly databases contained a suprising ammount of content on PCG in platformers.
I also managed to find the full text for all my papers with a quick google search.

Started planning COMP130 Kivy app based on the creative cards that were given to us. Mine were Ice and Creepy, and I decided to make the game asteroids as that is one of my favourite arcade games.
I created a very basic plan on Trello of what needed to be done, but as I don't completely understand Kivy yet, the trello board may contain cards that are not relevant to the project.

##Week 8
We got set the Tinkering Audio assignement which seemed pretty interesting, and I started playing around with modifying sounds using JES.
I managed to get the first two audio algorithms done just pretty quickly, as the knoweldge from the tinkering graphics project helped a lot.
Got feedback for the COMP130 essay, and as I already knew, I needed to improve my references and writing structure for the next COMP110 essay.
I still need to do more work for my tinkering graphics project to try and get it mostly done for before we breakup for christmas.

##Week 9
In week 9 I had made a litle bit more progress on the tinkering audio project.
Started on the COMP110 essay about procedural content generation for a 2d platformer, and chose 3 of the 5 PCG references to base my essay on. 
Initailly i found the essays quite hard to wrap my head around, however making key bullet points about the way in which each paper implemented PCG helped me a lot to get my head around them.

I also made a little more progress on the COMP130 kivy app, working on the server side is going quite well as i've already had a bit of experiane with SSH and linux terminals.
However I am still not very confident about SQL, and will have to read up more on that.

##Week 10
Continued working in pycharm to make the kivy app, it's taking me a while to understand how OOP works, and how all the code links together, as well as the kivy languange, but that is easier to understand.
Created the database on the server and managed to get my kivy app to print content from the database to a label, which was very satisfying when i got it to work.

Both the tinkeing audio and graphics are coming along pretty well.

##x1
Implemented a menu screen and a game screen. I also spent a while trying to get a ball moving around the screen, with no luck. Found some very useful kivy youtube tutorials that helped me understand the kivy languange and how OOP works.

##x2
Worked on the tinkering audio, implementing the first 4 algorithms, but when i got to trying to parse a token into the audio, it took me many iterations to get it working.

##x3
Made more progress on the Kivy app, the youtube tutorials helped a lot, and manged to move a rectangle around the screen on touch press, although there are still a few bus that needed to be fixed.

##x4
Finally implemented the parsing audio algorithm into the tinkering audio project, this took me a long time and quite a few iterations to get it working, there is still a few bugs with it though. 
All the other projects, such as the tinkeing graphics and the kivy app are coming along pretty well.

##Week 11
I did the code review as soon as we got back from holidays, it was helpful to see how other aproached the same problems I did.
I realsed that some of the images used in my tinkering graphics project may be copyrighted, so i'll have to go through them, and switch the images out for other non-copyrighted images at somepoint soon.
Started looking into C++ and made a hangman game in visual studio. I was anticipating a steep learning curve for C++ from python, but I generally managed to keep up during the lecture. 
However when i did have to stay behind in the lecture to fix some bugs with my hangman game, but managed to get it working and understand most of the things that was taught in the lecture.

##Week 12
Had a general support lecture, and made a bit more progress in my kivy app, as I managed to rotate the player to face direction of travel, I'm generaly feeling a lot more convident with kivy now. 
Also spent week 12 writing the reflective report, and had a lecture on how to write our refective report from one of the falmouth academic skills team.
